# Welcome to Ivy's EDA project on Seattle housing

This project is centered around exploratory data analysis techniques and presentation of results to a stakeholder who wants to purchase a house in Seattle with a middle price range budget in mind. The stakeholder also required that the location should be in a central and lively neighbourhood. 

This analysis aims to offer recommendations for the stakeholder, such as the best timing of the year, the best location, the budget and the consideration of living space.
